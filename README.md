# AI Survey

This Java program conducts a survey to guess a user's political party. It uses HashMaps to store questions, answers, and answer weights. After the survey, the program guesses the party based on weighted scores. It then asks the user for the actual party and updates answer weights accordingly, saving the data to a text file for future use.

## Overview

The AI Survey program is designed to interactively engage users in a survey to estimate their political affiliation. It prompts users with a series of questions and allows them to choose answers. Based on their responses, the program calculates a weighted score for each political party and makes a guess about the user's affiliation. It then asks the user to confirm their actual affiliation and updates the answer weights accordingly for future use.

## Functionality

- Conducts a survey to estimate the user's political affiliation.
- Calculates weighted scores for each political party based on user responses.
- Makes a guess about the user's political affiliation.
- Prompts the user to confirm their actual affiliation and updates answer weights accordingly.
- Saves answer weights to a text file for future use.

## Technologies Used

- Artificial Intelligence (AI)
- Java
- HashMap
- File I/O
- Random

## Usage

1. Compile the `AISurvey.java` file.
2. Run the compiled Java program.
3. Answer the survey questions presented.
4. Confirm your actual political affiliation when prompted.
5. The program will update answer weights based on your feedback.

## Files Included

- `AISurvey.java`: The main Java file containing the program logic.
- `answeights.txt`: Text file to store answer weights.

## Acknowledgments

This program was created as a learning exercise to demonstrate Java programming concepts such as HashMaps, file I/O, and randomization.
